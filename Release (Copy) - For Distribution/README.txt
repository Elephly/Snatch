==SNATCH==
Since we haven't done much to guide the
player IN the game, I figured I would
write this up so the player isn't completely
lost.

Also, don't touch anything in the Engine
folder or else you'll break everything...
And also don't touch that .dll in the Launch
folder. Actually, just dont touch anything
except for the .exe okay? It's just safer
that way.

-CONTROLS-
Movement - wasd
Aim/Look - mouse move
Interact - space bar
Next Level - n
Reload Level - r

-RULES & MECHANICS-
The next level and reload level controls are
available at any time during the game. As a
result, I don't suggest hitting either of them
on the menu screen, as I believe this will
cause the game to freeze.

Objects in the game that you can interact with
consist of doors, light switches, and levers.
Levers unlock doors, and light switches cause
the enemies to break from their paths to go
turn them back on.

With the lights on, enemies can see infinitely
in front of them until a wall obstructs their
view ("front" is the key word here - only a
straight line). However, when the lights are
off, enemies can only see a single space in front
of themselves.

If you are seen by an enemy, you have 3 seconds
(subject to a rebalance) to move from their line
of sight before you get game over. If you step on
the same space as an enemy (ie. get too close),
it's an instant game over.

When you get a game over, there is currently no
visual indication, however you will know immediately
because all controls lock. In this case, the you
are forced to either reload the level or continue
to the next level.
